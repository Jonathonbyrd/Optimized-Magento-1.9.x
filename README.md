This repository contains an optimized copy of Magento 1.9.x which can be installed on nearly any server. However, this was not designed for any server. This optimized copy was specifically built and tested on an optimized Ubuntu server at Amazon Web Services.

  - We first trimmed down the HVM Linux Ubuntu Server
  - The web server was built with Nginx and Varnish
  - Magento was installed and optimized for speed
  - Magento was enhanced with a AngularJS and NodeJS for an incredibly fast response time

For the best performance, you'll need to launch the AWS instance that we've put together for you. For larger Enterprise customers we've prepared a Virtual Private Cloud with AutoScaling Instances, Scalling Database Servers, Redis Cache, An Isolated Administrative Server, and Load Balancing to handle millions of simultaneous users.
